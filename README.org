The idea behind this project is being able to build your own PKI based on a couple of primitives.
We try to follow the structure of projects like XMonad. Have a good base configuration such that is well usable.
And by means of writing your own main you can slowly and steady change the system to fit your liking.

The base layer holds the logical representations and relation between facts.

To represent the base layer we have the view layer.
